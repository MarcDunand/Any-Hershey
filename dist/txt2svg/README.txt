Requirements:
-Windows device
-Inkscape downloaded


Setup:
-Unzip anywhere
-Double-click txt2svg.exe


Getting Started:
-Under 'Language preset', try selecting 'Latin (English)' and typing anything into the text box. Then press the generate SVG button to get a basic sense of how this tool works.
-Try switching 'Language preset', to 'Chinese (Simplified)' and typing anything, or copy this phrase '你好，世界' to see how the tool deals with logographic languages.


Capabilities:
-Can produce a Hershey font for anything you can type and organizes strokes for cutting/plotting
-Has fine-tuned settings for a number of common written languages:
	-English
	-Chinese (Simplified)
	-Chinese (Traditional)
	-Kanji (Japanese)
	-Hiragana (Japanese)
	-Katakana (Japanese)
	-Hangul (Korean)
	-Devanagari (Hindi-family)
	-Arabic


Notes:
-This project runs Inkscape in the background. Occasionally, the firewall can block this and you will need to let it through explicitly
-Whichever font you select should exist in your Inkscape fonts. If it does not, Inkscape will silently default to your standard font. See how to add fonts here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/manage-fonts-in-windows-f12d0657-2fc8-7613-c76f-88d043b334b8
-If converting a chunk of text that contains multiple writing systems, start with the 'Default' language preset and then fine tune from there.
